# Exhibition Center
An Exhibition center in the city hosts 
various events throughout the year, at
multiple locations. These events are of
different types: social, fundraising,
tech talks, arts and craft etc. At the
moment, each person who wishes to attend
an event has to create a unique login on
every different event host’s website, in
order to add each event to his/her calendar.
The Exhibition center’s management wants a
website that would present all the different
events on its own main website, which would
facilitate different event managers/hosts
to present their details on it, and event
attendees to sign-up for these events.
